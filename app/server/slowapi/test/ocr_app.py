The code below was generated by ChatGPT o3-mini-high, only by two interactions after feeding the README.md file.
Prompt1: Using SlowAPI, write an API server that accepts an image file by POST, performs OCR, and returns the text in JSON.
Prompt2: Add an option to specifiy the language

To install external libraries:
  sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
  pip install pytesseract
To run:
  curl -X POST --data-binary "@sample.jpg" -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg"  http://localhost:8000/ocr

AI's intermediate steps
-----------------------
Understanding the task: I'm piecing together a SlowAPI application that processes uploaded image files using OCR, and I’ll need to provide an example code.

Choosing the tools: I'm deciding between pytesseract and possibly another OCR library for processing uploaded images. Considering SlowAPI for micro-framework needs and file upload handling.

Examining file uploads: I’m mapping out how to parse file uploads in SlowAPI, though the documentation lacks explicit details. I’m considering using fastapi.UploadFile to streamline this process.

Understanding SlowAPI's constraints: SlowAPI supports handling POST requests with bytes but must handle multipart/form-data for file uploads. This requires specific parsing techniques to manage file uploads correctly.

Deciding on parsing methods: I'm leaning towards using pytesseract with an image file uploaded as raw bytes. Considering additional libraries for multipart form data, but documentation lacks details on multipart handling.
